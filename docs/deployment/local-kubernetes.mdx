:::info{type=info}
These instructions have been tested on MacOS with:
- minikube version: v1.27.1
- kind version: v0.17.0
- Docker version: 4.12.0
:::

This page guides you through deploying Visual Data Preparation (VDP) Open Source on local Kubernetes. <br />
To test locally, you can use one of the following local Kubernetes tools: <br />
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) with [Kubernetes enabled](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#enable-kubernetes)
- [Minikube](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#enable-kubernetes)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

Following setup tools and create a local Kubernetes cluster step as below, you could easily create a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube or Kind. <br />
In case of using Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled or you already have a local Kubernetes cluster created by your own tools, you could jump to deploy services step.
:::info{type=info}
If you using Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled, please run `make pull` at setup tools step to download all docker images before deploying services.
:::

## Setup tools

On the local machine, clone `vdp` repository in your workspace, move to the repository folder, and setup tools such as Minikube or Kind for creating a local Kubernetes cluster and Helm to deploy services into the cluster:

```shellscript
# Clone VDP project
cd <your-workspace>
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git
cd vdp/charts

# Download local Kubernetes tool such as Minikube or Kind
# Note Minikube limit download docker image within 2 minutes then this step will support minikube ssh to download large docker images including Triton Server and [Triton Conda Environment](https://github.com/instill-ai/triton-python-model)
make setup (or make setup kube=minikube) # default install minikube
# If you want use Kind, specify kube=kind
make setup kube=kind
# If you use Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled, download all docker images with below command.
# Otherwise, please skip it
make pull
```

## Create a local Kubernetes cluster
```shellscript
# create a local Kubernetes using tools such as Minikube or Kind
make start (or make start kube=minikube) # default using minikube
# If you want use Kind, specify kube=kind
make start kube=kind
```

## Deploy services
```shellscript
# deploy database, redis, namespace and secret
make init
# deploy Instill services
make install
```

In your browser, just visit http://localhost:3000 and start using VDP to make your own data ETL (refer to [Tutorial](http://localhost:3010/docs/tutorials/build-a-sync-cls-pipeline) sections).
