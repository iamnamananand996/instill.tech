---

Kubernetes offers an elastic way of managing VDP to persist the services and scale resources horizontally and vertically.

## Setup

VDP currently supports deploying on local Kubernetes.

### Cluster setup

We recommend using one of the local Kubernetes solutions:

- [Docker Desktop (macOS)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes)
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)

### `kubectl` setup

Make sure the Kubernetes CLI tool `kubectl` has been installed in your environment.
If not, please follow the official [instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) to install.

Make sure `kubectl` is configured to connect to the local cluster by

```bash
kubectl use-context <cluster-name>
```

### Helm setup

Make sure Helm has been installed in your environment. If not, please follow the official [instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install) to install.

Check out the VDP Helm repository on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/instill/vdp).

To add VDP Helm repository, simply run

```bash
helm repo add instill https://helm.instill.tech
```

, and

```bash
helm repo update
```

You can then run

```bash
helm search repo vdp --devel
```

to see the charts:

```bash
NAME            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
instill/vdp     0.1.0-alpha     0.6.0-alpha     Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP) empowers the mode...
```

:::info{type=info}
The VDP and its Helm chart are still in a pre-release Alpha version, so the `--devel` flag is necessary for the access of Helm charts.
:::

## Install

To install the chart:

```bash
helm install <my-release-name> instill/vdp --devel --namespace <my-namespace> --create-namespace
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall the chart:

```bash
helm uninstall <my-release-name> --namespace <my-namespace>
```

, and further clean up all VDP-related persistent volumes:

```bash
kubectl delete pvc --all -n <my-namespace>
kubectl delete namespace <my-namespace>
```
