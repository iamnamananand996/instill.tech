These instructions have been tested on MacOS.

## Setup and launch VDP

Install Docker and docker-compose on your local machine (see [instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)).

On the local machine, clone `vdp` repository in your workspace, move to the repository folder, and launch all dependent microservices:

```shellscript
# Clone VDP project
cd <your-workspace>
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git
cd vdp

# launch all VDP's services
make all
```

In your browser, just visit http://localhost:3000 and start using VDP to make your own data ETL (refer to [Tutorial](http://localhost:3010/docs/tutorials/build-a-sync-cls-pipeline) sections).
